              of all secondary schools are coeducational (schools of mixed genders)

              It is advised to compare schools with similar socio-educational
              advantages for fair evaluation. Therefore,
                <strong style="font-size: 19px; ">the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) </strong>
              comes into picture as a scale typically ranging 
              <strong style="font-size: 19px; ">from 500 (extremely disadvantaged) to 1300 (utmost priviliged).</strong>
              <br><br>ICSEA is based on
              <strong style="font-size: 19px;">a calculation of factors in socio-educational advantage (SEA), 
                school location remoteness, and percentage of Indigenous student enrolment</strong>. SEA alone 
              includes parental occupation, school education, and non-school education.
              <br>
              
              <br>
              Through Figure 2,
              <span style="color: darkviolet; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;"> catholic</span> schools are likely to score at
              around 1060 while 
              <span style="color: #6F8FAF; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;">government</span> & 
              <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;">independent</span> secondary schools tends to score 970. This translates to
              catholic schools having higher probability of better socio-educational advantage than schools from other sectors.

              since 
              calculation for ICSEA does not consider parents' income or school teaching resources.
              This can be emphasised through comparing ICSEA percentile
              (a ranking scale on Australian ICSEA) with number of teaching staff in Figure 3.

              <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px;">indicates mixed correlation</span> as there exists 
              schools (mainly under government) with  
              <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px;">low ICSEA

              As with the rest, ICSEA scales uniformly to its percentile and so are the majority of cases
              between number of teaching staff and total enrolments of students (its trend will be elaborated
              more in Figure 4 below).

            As seen previously, majority of the relationship between total number of teaching staff and student enrolment
            are proportional scale in horizontal lines. As calculated, 
             Melbourne secondary schools have 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px;">roughly 10 students assigned to one teacher 
          regardless of its sector</span>, according to Figure 4. 
          This can be visualised in concentration
          of dots, forming 
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px;">an upward linear trend of 1:10</span>

          <p class="body-font">The trend of 1:10 is demonstrated through 
             scaling number of teachers against number of 
          students in groups of 10 with each dot representing a school. The ratio begins to diverge away from the trend at 2000 students. 
           
            Schools on all sectors have<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px;"> a fair share
            on teaching staff number depending on number of student enrolment</span> and

              community support and cultural connection for indigenous children as part of their growth and identity. 
              Hence, identifying suburbs with relatively high indigenous 
              enrolment would be a key start in the selection process. In Figure 5 of the Greater Melbourne area, percentage of indigenous student enrolment in secondary

          gradient scale. Suburbs that are in light gray either have no secondary school or lack enrolment data.
          Indigenous enrolment increases the further you are from the Central Business District (CBD).
